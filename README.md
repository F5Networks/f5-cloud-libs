# Library code and scripts for deploying BIG-IP in a cloud

This project consists of two main parts
- scripts
    - Command line scripts for configuring BIG-IP
    - These are meant to be called either directly from the command line or from cloud deployment templates
    - See usage below

- lib
    - Library code for controlling a BIG-IP
    - Called from the scripts

## Release notes
### Version 3.4.0
* Autoscale improvements
    * Handle replacing master
    * Revoke license if licensed from BIG-IQ

### Version 3.3.0
* License BIG-IP from BIG-IQ 5.2 and 5.3

### Version 3.2.0
* Support for S3 ARN for licensing via BIG-IQ

### Version 3.1.0
* Support for licensing via BIG-IQ
* Support for service discovery

### Version 3.0.1
* Add retry for password-url when licensing via BIG-IQ.

### Version 3.0.0
**This version is not backwards compatible. The format for options on network.js has changed.
See node scripts/network.js --help for details**

* License BIG-IP from BIG-IQ 5.0 and 5.1
* More options for network.js
    * Add arbitrary routes
    * Support mtu on vlans
    * Support port lockdown on self IPs
* Updates to signaling. --wait-for now means 'run if the signal has been sent' rather than 'run when the signal is sent'
* More robust reboot handling.

### Version 2.3.0

* Fixes race condition when running multiple f5-cloud-libs scripts at once

### Version 2.0.0
* onboard.js option of --set-password is no longer available, use --update-user instead.
* All scripts that take --password now also support --password-url. Only 'file' URLs are supported for now.
* Added option to suppress console output (--no-console).
* Added support for verifying hash of downloaded f5-cloud-libs tarball.
* Added some parsing of sync messages to get sync to work more often.
